# Configuration

This ChIP-seq pipeline follows the same configuration pattern as the RNA-seq
pipeline.

Most users should edit only:

```text
config/user_settings.sh
config/metadata.tsv
```

Create them with:

```bash
bash scripts/init_project.sh
```

`config/pipeline_config.sh` is the advanced configuration engine. It loads
`config/user_settings.sh` automatically and defines all derived paths and
defaults used by the scripts.

Useful settings in `config/user_settings.sh`:

- `PIPELINE_EXECUTOR`: use `slurm` or `local`
- `CONDA_BASE`: path to Conda on the HPC server
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: light project outputs such as logs, copied configs, and reports
- `WORK_ROOT`: heavy outputs on scratch, including indexes, trimmed FASTQs,
  BAMs, peaks, tracks, and count matrices
- `PIPELINE_COMPRESS_RESULTS`: use `1` to write large TSV-like outputs as
  `.tsv.gz`; downstream steps read `.tsv` and `.tsv.gz`
- `PIPELINE_STORAGE_MODE`: use `full`, `balanced`, or `minimal` to control
  cleanup after the final report

Gzipped reference files are supported:

```bash
export GENOME_FASTA="/path/to/genome.fa.gz"
export ANNOTATION_FILE="/path/to/annotation.gtf.gz"
```

They are decompressed into `010-reference/data/` before indexing.

`config/pipeline_config.local.example.sh` is kept only for backward
compatibility with an earlier ChIP-seq layout. Prefer
`config/user_settings_template.sh`.
